== Algorithms & Data Structures

=== Why study Algorithms
- They're everywhere.
- Old roots, new Opportunities.

> > An Algorithm must be seen to be Believed

=== How to design an Algorithm

- Model the Problem
- Find an Algorithm to solve it.
- Is it fast enough, does it Fit memory.
- Improve.

=== Problem : Union Find

*Dynamic Connectivity :*

- Union command to connect to objects.
- Connected command to see if the objects are connected or not.

==== Model the Connections :
- *Reflexive: * _p_ is connected to _p_
- *Symmetric: * if _p_ is connected to _q_, then _q_ is connected to _p_
- *Transitive: * if _p_ is connected to _q_, then _p_ is connected to _r_, So _q_ is connected to _r_

*Connected Components: * Maximal set of objects that are manually connected. 

*Implementing the Operations: * 
- Find Query 
- Union Command

==== Union find data type (API)
